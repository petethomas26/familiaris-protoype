# Familiaris (Prototype)
A prototype family tree website.<br>
The focus is on individual people, their personal data and history, and the relationships between people.<br>
The website is intended for members of a family to build up their family tree by adding people to the tree  
and editing personal data and histories of each person.<br>
The website also manages the processes of registration to become a member of Familiaris and logging in to the website. Membership is by invitation only 
(an existing member can invite members of their family to join).
